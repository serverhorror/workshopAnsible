============================

This is the git repository for my ansible workshop. Each step of the workshop will be marked with a git tag and instructions within this file.

## Step 1: The setup

You should have Vagrant, Virtualbox and ansible installed. If so, please run `vagrant up` to boot all three boxes. Afterwards, the command `ansible -i hosts all -m ping` shows that all three hosts are available. Awesome, let's move on!
